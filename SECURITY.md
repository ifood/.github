# Security Policy

Before a project be opened inside the iFood Open Source community, the internal security team scans the code to identify possible existent vulnerabilities, that need to be corrected until the launch. With the security team giving the "OK", the project will be published in iFood GitHub without the previous git history, to prevent exposed keys.

All new source code received by pull request will be scanned by a security pipeline that will detect vulnerabilities, sensitive data, exposed secrets, vulnerable dependencies, etc.. All issues identified by the pipeline need to be solved to be able to merge.

The project also will be followed by a security champion during all your life cycle, that will be a support for security reports analysis, and a required pull request reviewer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for all that report vulnerabilities to the iFood Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

To make a report, email your vulnerability to oss-security@ifood.com.br. This allows triage and handling of the vulnerability with standardized response times.
