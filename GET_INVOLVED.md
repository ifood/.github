# Get Involved

Contributing to iFood projects is not only about code. There are may ways to help a project to grow, and we list below some ideas:

- Using a project. Go through the Getting started guide, and if you look somenthing wrong, let us know by [opening an issue](#reporting-new-issues).
- Look through the project open issues. Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help [triage issues](#triaging-issues-and-pull-requests).
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](#your-first-pull-request).
- Read through the project docs. If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can open a issue or a pull request with a change suggestion.
- Take a look at the features requested by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ifood/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

iFood has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://github.com/ifood/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.


## Issues

When opening a new issue, always make sure to fill out the issue template. **This step is very important!** Not doing so may result in your issue not being managed in a timely fashion. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend filing an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

### Security Bugs

To safely disclosure, all security issues must be sent by  the email security-oss@ifood.com.br. This is required to each report be acknowledged, analyzed and classified by the internal iFood security team, and treated and published in the best way. **Please, do not file public issues.**

For more information, read our [security document](https://github.com/ifood/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Pull Requests

This is the principal way that the community will use to share your code with the project, and needs to be described clearly to help the project team review. 

So, it`s required to follow some best practices that all pull requests, to help newer contributors and standardize, giving minimal important information to the reviewer about the code:

1. **Keep your PR small.** Small pull requests (~300 lines of diff) are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, and be related to just one issue, otherwise try to split it.
2. **Use descriptive titles.** It`s helps to quickly identify what the PR is about.
3. **Test your changes.** And describe how to test your pull request.
4. **CLA.** If you haven't already, [sign the CLA](https://github.com/ifood/.github/blob/main/CLA.md).

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for another iFood open source project, you're good to go. iFood uses the [cla-bot project](https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/) to check the CLA assignment into all Pull Requests. To sign, the user must go to https://github.com/ifood/clabot-config project, and commit a change adding your GitHub user inside the .clabot file.

After you have signed the CLA, must add a new PR comment with `@cla-bot check` message, that will trigger the bot and update the PR status. There's no need to open a new PR.

**CLAs are required for us to merge your pull request.** While we value your effort and are willing to wait for you to come back and address the reviews in case you are unavailable after sending the pull request, pull requests that are ready to merge but have CLA missing and no response from the author **will be closed within two weeks of opening**. If you have further questions about the CLA, please stay in touch with us.

If it happens that you were unavailable and your PR gets closed, feel free to reopen once it's ready! We are still happy to review it, help you complete it, and eventually merge it.

## Triaging Issues and Pull Requests

One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest labels that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.
